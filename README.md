# Exploiting Booster Pass Chain for Compiler Phase Ordering

This repository is currently used to store essential materials for our submission to ASPLOS'25.

* The `pass_description.txt` file contains descriptions of the 124 transform passes from LLVM 10.0.0 used in our experiments.

* The `BPC_set.txt` file stores the BPC generated at the termination of our iterative algorithm. The passes are described using numbers, each ranging from 0 to 123, corresponding sequentially to the passes listed in the `pass_description.txt` file.

* The `BPC_coreset.txt` file contains the BPC coreset generated at the termination of our iterative algorithm, consisting of 50 pass sequences. The passes are also described using numbers, each ranging from 0 to 123, corresponding sequentially to the passes listed in the `pass_description.txt` file.

Code is coming soon.
